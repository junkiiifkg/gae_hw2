# Restaurant Bot üçΩÔ∏è

This C++ console application acts as a restaurant bot. It helps users build a menu, get food recommendations based on their taste preferences, and uses a simple linear regression model to predict user satisfaction.

## Features

* **Interactive Menu:** Add, remove, update, and view items on your personal menu.

* **AI-Powered Suggestions:**

  * Get a random menu suggestion optimized by an AI model for the best-predicted satisfaction.

  * Request a menu tailored to your specific taste profile (sweet, salty, sour, bitter, umami/savory).

* **Satisfaction-Based Learning:** Train a linear regression model by rating your suggested or final menu to improve future recommendations.

* **Dynamic Menu:** Loads menu items from an external `menu.json` file.

* **Persistent AI Model:** The AI model's weights are saved to and loaded from `weights.json`.

* **Object-Oriented Design:** Uses inheritance, composition, and association to model menu items, menus, and users.
